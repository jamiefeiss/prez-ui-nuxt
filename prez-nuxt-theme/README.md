# Prez UI Theme
This is a template of creating a themed instance of the refactored version of Prez UI in Nuxt 3. By using Nuxt layers, you can override & customise Prez UI's components & pages.

This project will aim to be easily pulled to quickly spin up instances by converting this project into an NPX starter template by running a command like:

```bash
npx create prez-nuxt-theme
```

which will create a Nuxt projects as a good starting template to run & customise Prez UI.
